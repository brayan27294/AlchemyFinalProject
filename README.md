This is a Certification Dapp

## Project Layout

There are two top-level folders:

1. `/ui` - contains the front-end application
2. `/api` - contains the back-end application

The API folder contains the smart contracts and the hardhat logic:

1. `/contracts` - contains the solidity contract
2. `/src` - contains the source code
3. `/tests` - contains tests for the solidity contract

## Setup

First, you need to compile the contracts using `npm run hardhat-compile`. 

## Back-End

`cd` into the `/api` directory and run `npm install`

Compile the contracts using `npm run hardhat-compile`

To run the back-end application run `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.


## Front-End

`cd` into the `/ui` directory and run `npm install`

To run the front-end application run `npm start`. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
